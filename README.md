#### Description:
The `circle_propagation` function simulates the propagation of sound waves in a room. It visualizes the sound pressure level (SPL) at various positions over time, considering reflections off the room boundaries.

#### Inputs:
- `Length`: Length of the room (in meters).
- `width`: Width of the room (in meters).
- `xPos`, `yPos`: Coordinates of the sound source position.
- `spldB`: Sound pressure level of the source (in dB SPL) at 1 meter.
- `absorb`: Absorption coefficient of the room's boundaries.
- `tmax`: Length of animation (time in seconds).
- `nPoints`: Number of points to model in the circular propagation.

#### Outputs:
- None

#### Notes:
- The simulation uses a simple circle representation for the room and calculates reflections based on room boundaries.
- SPL visualization uses color coding to represent different SPL ranges.
